CS 145 - Project 1

The rules in controller/controller_circle.py for now just represent entries in a table telling
each switch where to find each host. When h1 tries to communicate with h3, it sends a packet to
the nearest switch (s1 in this case), and s1 has a record of where to find h3 and routes the
packet accordingly.
